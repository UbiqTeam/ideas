sketches and brain storming



When driver-less cars become common-place, they will no longer have sterring wheels or pedals. Human input will be simply destination. If these cars are to be adopted, then there will also be a need to navigate parking lots/garages, drive-thrus, gas stations. While the cars should be able to do basic navigation, there will be a need for each location to broadcast specialized, local data.

 Parking lots/garages:
      amount of spaces available
      location of spaces available
      pay-in-car
      
      Temporary parking such as fairs or fields:
          mobile deployment of custom parking area
          
 Gas stations:
      pumps available
      arrival/departure sensors
      time to full
      select/pay-in-car
      
 Drive-thrus:
      custom mapping for drive-thru
      order/pay-in-car
      
 Intersections:
    time to light change
    integration of public transport
